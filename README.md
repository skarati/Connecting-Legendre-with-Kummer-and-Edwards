# Connecting-Legendre-with-Kummer-and-Edwards
This repository contains the associated MAGMA and SAGE scripts with the article
"Connecting Legendre with Kummer and Edwards". 

Implementors:
     Sabyasachi Karati, and
     Palash Sarkar

The follwoing gives the puposes of the available scripts.

1. tbl4_k2l.m
        This is a MAGMA script which contains the verification of the conversion of points from KL to Legendre
        presented in the Table 4.
        
2. tbl4_l2k.m
        This is a MAGMA script which contains the verification of the conversion of points from Legendre to KL
        presented in the Table 4.
        
3. tbl5.m
        This is a MAGMA script which contains the verification of the values listed in cloumn under (x,y)
        presented in the Table 5.
        
4. tbl6.sage
        This is a SAGE script which contains the verification of the formulas to find a point of order 4 for a
        Legendre curve presented in the Table 6.
        
5. sec5.m
        This is a MAGMA script which generates the concrete Twisted Edwards curves and the corresponding base
        points which are listed in the Section 5.
